Site Sender
===========
The Concept
-----------
So, you're using your mobile device to browse the internet and you get back home - or you find a site that needs flash, you don't want to be typing that URL into your computer!

Cue SiteSender! You make use of a bookmarklet and the page you're viewing is sent to the SiteSender online bookmark repository, if your computer is running the SiteSender target application then that URL will pop up on your computer immediately.

I want!
-------
Its not ready for full-time duty just yet, but if you're brave enough to get this target app running on your own then the online section is already running on [heroku][1]. If you don't already know, [heroku][1]: Best. RoR host. Ever.
